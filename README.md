# Hustle

Example iOS development project in the form of a Dribbble client. This project can be used as a bootstrap for you next iOS app or for example code. There is also a presentation deck in the project that will break down the iterations taken to build Hustle. Follow along in the presentation or on my blog at http://cargocultblog.com

# Project goals

- Teach how to greatly increase development velocity on iOS by leveraging multiple open source projects provided by the community.
- Demo my workflow from idea to launching on the App Store.
- Have a sandbox project to try some interesting things I can't do in a production app.
